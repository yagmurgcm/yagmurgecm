DSA210 Term Project
Overview
I am Yağmur Geçim, a student at Sabancı University, and this repository contains my DSA210 term
project. The objective of this project is to analyze how my daily mood is influenced by social
media usage (YouTube & Instagram) and sleep duration using self-collected data.
Hypotheses
This study tests the following two hypotheses:
1. Social Media and Mood: If my social media usage exceeds a certain threshold, I am more
likely to experience sadness.
2. Late-Night Social Media and Sleep: If I engage with social media after 12 AM, it
indicates that I will have inadequate sleep, which may negatively impact my mood the
following day.

Motivation
Daily mood is an essential indicator of overall well-being, and it can be significantly influenced by
sleep duration & quality and social media consumption. Understanding the correlation between
social media usage, sleep patterns, and mood may help in better time management for both
sleep and social media usage. By analyzing data collected from the Samsung Health app, this
study aims to:
• Examine the correlation between social media usage and daily mood.
• Investigate the relationship between sleep patterns and daily mood.
• Derive actionable insights to improve my overall mood and well-being.
Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to uncover patterns in my daily mood in relation to social
media usage and sleep patterns. By leveraging data from the Samsung Health app (including
sleep hours, social media activity, and mood tracking), this study aims to provide insights into
how social media engagement and sleep duration & quality influence mood.
Data Sources and Preprocessing
The dataset used in this study is collected from the Samsung Health app, which provides the
following metrics:
• Sleep Hours: Total sleep duration, sleep start and end times.
• Social Media Usage: Time spent on specific apps (YouTube & Instagram).
• Mood Tracker: Self-reported mood rating (on a scale from 1 to 5) recorded at the end of
each day.
The data will be cleaned and processed to ensure consistency and accuracy before conducting the
analysis.
Next Steps
The project will proceed with data analysis, hypothesis testing, and the application of machine
learning techniques to uncover patterns and insights. Future work may include expanding the
dataset, incorporating additional variables, and refining the analysis to enhance predictive
accuracy.
Stay tuned for updates as I continue to analyze my data and share my findings!
