# Analysis of the Relationship Between TCMB Interest & Inflation Rates and Google Search Trends

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between the monthly interest and inflation rates published by the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (TCMB) and the frequency of Google searches for the terms **inflation, interest rate, euro, and dollar**. By examining search trends over the past five years, this study seeks to understand how economic concerns influence public interest in these topics.

## Hypotheses
This study tests the following hypotheses:

1. **Interest Rate Changes and Search Trends:** Increases or decreases in TCMB’s interest rates correlate with fluctuations in search volumes for "faiz" (interest rate) and "dollar/euro."
2. **Inflation and Public Interest:** Rising inflation leads to increased searches for "enflasyon" (inflation), as the public seeks more information about its impact on daily life.

## Motivation
Macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates and inflation significantly affect a country’s financial environment. Public perception and reaction to economic changes can be observed through online search trends. By studying the relationship between TCMB’s monetary policies and public interest in financial terms, this project aims to:

- Identify correlations between monetary policies and public concern about inflation and exchange rates.
- Understand how interest rate adjustments influence search behaviors.
- Examine whether financial uncertainty is reflected in search trends for "dollar" and "euro."
- Provide insights into how digital data can be used to track economic sentiment.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the interaction between **TCMB’s interest and inflation rates** and **Google search trends for economic terms** over the past five years. By using monthly data, this study seeks to uncover potential patterns and relationships that indicate public reaction to economic changes.

## Data Sources and Preprocessing
The dataset for this study will be collected from the following sources:

- **TCMB Data:** Monthly interest rate and inflation statistics.
- **Google Trends Data:** Monthly search frequency of the terms **inflation, interest rate, euro, and dollar.**

### Preprocessing Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Ensuring consistency between different data sources.
2. **Time Alignment:** Synchronizing economic data and Google Trends data by month.
3. **Normalization:** Adjusting search volumes to account for overall changes in Google search activity.
