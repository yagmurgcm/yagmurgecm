# DSA210 Term Project

## Overview
I am Yağmur Geçim, a student at Sabancı University, and this repository contains my DSA210 term project. The objective of this project is to analyze the relationship between my study focus time and key influencing factors such as my daily mood, sleep hours, and social media usage. By examining self-collected data, I aim to identify patterns that affect my ability to concentrate and optimize my study habits accordingly.

## Hypotheses
This study tests the following hypotheses:

1. **Mood and Study Focus:** A positive daily mood is associated with longer and more productive study sessions, whereas a negative mood leads to reduced focus time.
2. **Sleep Hours and Study Focus:** Insufficient sleep negatively impacts my ability to concentrate and reduces my overall study efficiency.
3. **Social Media Usage and Study Focus:** Higher social media usage, particularly before study sessions, leads to decreased focus time due to distraction and cognitive overload.

## Motivation
The ability to focus during study sessions is crucial for academic success. However, multiple factors such as mood, sleep quality, and social media usage may influence concentration levels. Understanding how these variables interact can help optimize study habits and improve overall productivity. By analyzing self-collected data, this study aims to:

- Examine how daily mood affects study focus time.
- Investigate the impact of sleep duration on concentration and study efficiency.
- Assess whether social media usage influences my ability to maintain focus during study sessions.
- Identify patterns that could improve my time management and academic performance.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to uncover patterns in my study focus time in relation to my mood, sleep hours, and social media usage. By leveraging data from the Samsung Health app (including sleep hours, social media activity, and mood tracking) and manually recorded study focus times (Forest), this study aims to provide actionable insights for improving my study habits.

## Data Sources and Preprocessing
The dataset used in this study is collected from the **Samsung Health app** and personal study logs(Forest), providing the following metrics:

- **Mood Tracker:** Self-reported mood rating (on a scale from 1 to 5) recorded at the end of each day.
- **Sleep Hours:** Total sleep duration, sleep start and end times.
- **Social Media Usage:** Time spent on specific apps (YouTube & Instagram) before and during study periods.
- **Study Focus Time:** The duration of uninterrupted, high-concentration study sessions recorded daily.

The data will be cleaned and processed to ensure consistency and accuracy before conducting the analysis.

## Next Steps
The project will proceed with data analysis, hypothesis testing, and the application of machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and insights. Future work may include expanding the dataset, incorporating additional variables, and refining the analysis to enhance predictive accuracy.
